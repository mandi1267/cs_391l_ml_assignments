This folder contains work for CS 391L assignment 1. 

The objective of this assignment is to develop a classifier for the MNIST digit data set that computes an eigenvector representation of the data based on the training set, and then uses this representation as features for a classifier that is then trained. 

This should then transform the test data to use the same representation and then test the classifier on the test data.
